# Tutorials for using BRIE

There are three data sets used in the BRIE2 manuscript, which can also serve as
tutorial materials.

1. Differential splicing events on multiple sclerosis, see 
   [msEAE](./msEAE) folder
   
2. Differential momentum genes for RNA velocity on scNT-seq data, see 
   [scNTseq](./scNTseq) folder
   
3. Differential momentum genes for RNA velocity on scNT-seq data, see 
   [dentateGyrus](./dentateGyrus) folder

All analysis notebook can be found within the folders, together with links for
pre-computed files and command lines.

Already built html format is available in BRIE2's documentation:
https://brie.readthedocs.io.
